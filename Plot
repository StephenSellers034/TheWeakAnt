Billy the ant was born different
Billy was weaker than the other ants
Billy could only lift his body weight
Unlike the other ants who could lift ten times their body weight
Everyone laughed at Billy and called him weak
One day everything changed for Billy
Billy was walking and saw another ant hurt
Billy knew he wasn't a strong ant 
Still Billy picked up bob the hurt ant
Then took him to the hospital to get help
